# Face-Recognition-MATLAB
The file named "FaceRecognition.m" is the main MATLAB script file that contains the code for Facial Recognition inLive Stream using Machine Learning in MATLAB using the Computer Vision System Toolbox. In order to run the project you must create a folder named - 'OurClass' which will contain the training data set, i.e. images of the user in a folder with the name of the user.
Another folder named 'testClass' should be created which would contain all the images which are to be tested.
The additional file named as 'Facetobecropped.m' is a program for creating an even Dataset (pre-processing step). An uneven dataset can lead to decrease in accuracy of the system.
